To get started, read the introduction to R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.

Then, skip down and read parts Part II: Wrangle, which covers chapters 9-12 (you can read parts 13-16 too if you want additional details).

These readings supplement the videos. Together, they provide a good foundation for getting started with the tidyverse.
