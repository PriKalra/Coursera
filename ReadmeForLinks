welcome to R link: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/
Tidyverse link: https://www.tidyverse.org/

To get started, read the introduction to R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.

https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html

Then, skip down and read parts Part II: Wrangle, which covers chapters 9-12 (you can read parts 13-16 too if you want additional details).

https://r4ds.had.co.nz/wrangle-intro.html  

These readings supplement the videos. Together, they provide a good foundation for getting started with the tidyverse.

Plotting themes: 
ggthemes contains pre-baked themes that you can try and modify
#####allyourfigurearebelongtous for pictures of themes

https://ggplot2-book.org/polishing.html
https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#section-themes
https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html

In order to make correlation and bar plits: GGAlly etc. 
Adding best fit regression lines: geomsmooth("lm") etc. https://r-graphics.org/recipe-scatter-fitlines
Tidyverse: geomsmooth and statsmooth are allies https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html
Scatter: ggpairs () from ggally : https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/Other.html#scatterplot-matrix
Correlation plots: https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/Models.html#Corrplot -> find correlation pairs
Can use dot plots and lollipop plots for a hybrid of scatter and barplots for data: https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/300-basic-lollipop-plot.html or https://r-graphics.org/recipe-bar-graph-dot-plot

EXTENSIONS OF SCATTER PLOTS:

Shade under the line plot: https://r-graphics.org/recipe-line-graph-area
Shade area under the line plot and Stack it: Use geom_area() andmap a factor to fill  -> https://r-graphics.org/recipe-line-graph-stacked-area

Dumbell charts to display change between two time points for several groups or observations. The geom_dumbbell function from the ggalt package is used. :https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/Time.html#dummbbell-charts
